/**
 * This service registers a flow factory that is used when a initiating party attempts to communicate with us
 * using a particular flow. Registration is done against a marker class (in this case, [TemplateFlow.Initiator])
 * which is sent in the session handshake by the other party. If this marker class has been registered then the
 * corresponding factory will be used to create the flow which will communicate with the other side. If there is no
 * mapping, then the session attempt is rejected.
 *
 * In short, this bit of code is required for the recipient in this scenario to respond to the sender using the
 * [TemplateFlow.Acceptor] flow.
